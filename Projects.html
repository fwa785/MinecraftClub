                            <strong>HeadHunt</strong> is a minigame that was proposed by Evan and Albert.
                            The plugin was coded by Derek and the maps were built by the club.
                            You start the game by typing /yell and having people join the queue,
                            then you all get teleported to the arena and start fighting each other.
                            After each kill, you will get one head.
                            The goal of the game is to get the most heads by the end of the timer on the scoreboard.

                        <p><strong>The Nian battle</strong> is a custom boss that was created for Chinese New Year.
                        You spawn the boss in with /startfight and it has multiple unique abilities that it can
                        use to fight you, such as throwing blocks at you or launching you in the air.
                        Based on the story, Nian is more vulnerable to fire and loud sounds so fireworks and lava
                        will deal more damage to it. After you defeat the boss, it drops 600 gold blocks as your reward.</p>

                            <p><strong>Hide or Hunt</strong> is a minigame that was created by some
                                YouTubers who played it and uploaded it to Youtube. But the game download
                                wasn't public so Derek coded his own version. When the game starts,
                                you want to gather resources and build a base and hid your
                                <strong>Beacon</strong> in it. The beacon is the thing that lets you
                                respawn, without it, you cannot respawn when you die. After a while,
                                you will try to go out and find other peoples bases and try to break
                                their beacons. The last team with a beacon wins.</p>
                            <p> It was used in multiple events to help students to socialize during the pandemic </p>
